Raison d'Ãªtre
-------------

Comprehensive, low-level DNS toolkits can be cumbersome for the more common zone management tasks--especially those related to making simple changes to zone records. They can also come with a steep learning curve. Enter localzone: a simple library for managing DNS zones. While `localzone` may be a low-calorie library, it's stuffed full of everything that a hungry hostmaster needs.
